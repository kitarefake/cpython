Provide :c:func:`Py_EnterRecursiveCall` and :c:func:`Py_LeaveRecursiveCall`
as regular functions for the limited API. Previously, there were defined as
macros, but these macros didn't work with the limited API which cannot access
``PyThreadState.recursion_depth`` field. Remove ``_Py_CheckRecursionLimit``
from the stable ABI.
