:pep:`553` - Add a new built-in called ``breakpoint()`` which calls
``sys.breakpointhook()``.  By default this imports ``pdb`` and calls
``pdb.set_trace()``, but users may override ``sys.breakpointhook()`` to call
whatever debugger they want.  The original value of the hook is saved in
``sys.__breakpointhook__``.
