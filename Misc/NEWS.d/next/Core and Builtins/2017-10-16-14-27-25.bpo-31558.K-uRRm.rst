``gc.freeze()`` is a new API that allows for moving all objects currently
tracked by the garbage collector to a permanent generation, effectively
removing them from future collection events. This can be used to protect
those objects from having their PyGC_Head mutated. In effect, this enables
great copy-on-write stability at fork().
