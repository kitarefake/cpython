Release build and debug build are now ABI compatible: the ``Py_DEBUG`` define
no longer implies ``Py_TRACE_REFS`` define which introduces the only ABI
incompatibility. A new ``./configure --with-trace-refs`` build option is now
required to get ``Py_TRACE_REFS`` define which adds :func:`sys.getobjects`
function and ``PYTHONDUMPREFS`` environment variable.
